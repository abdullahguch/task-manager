# Task Manager

This is a simple Python script for managing tasks. Users can add tasks, view tasks, and mark tasks as completed.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

>> git clone https://github.com/abdullahguch/task-manager.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

>> cd task-manager

## Usage

1. Run the `task_manager.py` script.

>> python task_manager.py

2. Select an option from the menu:
   - Enter `1` to add a task.
   - Enter `2` to view tasks.
   - Enter `3` to mark a task as completed.
   - Enter `4` to exit the task manager.

3. Follow the prompts to perform the selected operation.

## Notes

- The task manager stores tasks and their completion status in a `tasks.txt` file. In order to run the code, there needs to be a `tasks.txt` file in the same folder.
- Task indices start from 1 when viewing tasks.
- The code uses UTF-8 encoding, therefore supports writing tasks in different languages.
